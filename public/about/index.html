<h1>About | il0g.com : Indrasen Pilankar aka Varun on Tech, Life, Business and more</h1>
<br/>
<p><img src="me_grid.jpg#floatright" alt=""><em>Me in Variable Expression</em></p>
<p>I am Indrasen Pilankar (aka Varun, my close circle calls me that), a seasoned Computer Science Instructor with a rich experience spanning over 8 years in the computational field. My journey in this domain has been nothing short of fascinating, filled with constant learning and exploration. I have a deep-seated passion for technology and its myriad applications, which is reflected in my diverse interests.</p>
<p>Networking is one area that particularly intrigues me. The idea of connecting systems and sharing resources is a concept that I find profoundly impactful. I have had the privilege of working on various open source projects in this domain, each of which has enriched my understanding and honed my skills.</p>
<p>My fascination with technology extends to the Internet of Things (IoT), a revolutionary field that merges the physical and digital worlds. I am also deeply interested in Cloud Computing, a technology that has transformed the way businesses operate by offering scalable and flexible solutions.</p>
<p>Being an avid Linux user, I appreciate the flexibility and control it offers. I am also enthusiastic about Android, the world’s most popular mobile operating system, and its potential to shape the future of mobile technology.</p>
<p>Ever since I was a child, I’ve had a penchant for understanding how things work. Rather than merely using devices, I’ve always been more interested in dissecting them and comprehending their inner workings. This curiosity has led me to become a hardcore hardware enthusiast.</p>
<p>I derive immense satisfaction from building devices such as tablets and storage devices from scratch. The process of assembling various components to create a fully functional device is incredibly fulfilling. Additionally, I enjoy troubleshooting and resolving tech-related issues, which keeps me engaged and challenged.</p>
<p>However, my life isn’t all about technology. I am a cat lover and enjoy the companionship of these adorable creatures. Their playful antics and affectionate nature bring a lot of joy to my life. I am also an avid basketball player. The thrill of the game and the camaraderie with my teammates is something I deeply cherish.</p>
